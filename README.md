# text-to-speach
Text-to-Speech Project  This project demonstrates the implementation of a text-to-speech (TTS) feature using JavaScript and HTML. The application allows users to input text and convert it into spoken words using the Web Speech API. The interface is simple and user-friendly, with a text input field and a button to initiate the speech synthesis.
eatures:

#Text input field for users to enter the text they want to be read aloud.
A button to trigger the speech synthesis.
Adjustable voice and pitch settings to customize the speech output.
Technologies Used:

#HTML: For creating the structure and layout of the user interface.
JavaScript: For handling the text-to-speech conversion using the Web Speech API.
How It Works:

#The user enters text into the input field.
Upon clicking the button, JavaScript code invokes the SpeechSynthesis API to convert the text into speech.
The browser’s built-in voice synthesis engine reads the text aloud, and users can hear the output through their speakers.
Usage:
To use the application, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Enter any text into the input field and click the “Speak” button to hear the text spoken aloud.
