# text-to-speach
Text-to-Speech Project  This project demonstrates the implementation of a text-to-speech (TTS) feature using JavaScript and HTML. The application allows users to input text and convert it into spoken words using the Web Speech API. The interface is simple and user-friendly, with a text input field and a button to initiate the speech synthesis.
